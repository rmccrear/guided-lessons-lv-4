# Test Chapter

This chapter demonstrates dynamic markdown loading from a file.

## Lesson 1: Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson in the test chapter. This content is loaded directly from a markdown file at runtime.

### Key Points

- No pre-compilation needed
- Edit markdown and see changes
- Faster iteration cycle

**This is bold text** and this is `inline code`.

## Lesson 2: Features

This lesson shows off some markdown features:

### Lists

- Unordered list item 1
- Unordered list item 2
- Unordered list item 3

### Numbered Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Code Example

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello from markdown!');
}
```

## Lesson 3: Tables

Here's a table example:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Headers | ✅ | Working |
| Tables | ✅ | Working |
| Images | ✅ | Working |
| Links | ✅ | [Example](https://example.com) |

## Lesson 4: Final Thoughts

This is the final lesson in the test chapter. The dynamic loading feature allows you to:

- Update markdown without rebuilding
- Keep content separate from code
- Iterate faster on lesson content

**Success!** The markdown loading feature is working correctly.
