**Goal:** Understand the ecosystem of tools we will use to learn SQL.

**User Story:** As a student, I want to understand the difference between our practice environment (SQL Zoo) and our production environment (Supabase) so I can learn effectively.

---

## 📘 Introduction

SQL Zoo is a fantastic, free online platform for learning SQL through hands-on practice. It provides a simple website interface where you can run queries against real databases directly in your browser.

We will use SQL Zoo to learn the syntax, and then apply that knowledge to Supabase, a modern backend-as-a-service that uses PostgreSQL.

## Instructions
1.  Read the description above.
2.  Click the button below to open SQL Zoo in a new tab.
3.  Keep this app open to track your progress!

**Goal:** Learn how to retrieve specific columns from a table.

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I need to extract specific population data so that I can answer questions about different countries.

---

## What You'll Do

The \`SELECT\` statement is the foundation of SQL. It allows you to choose which columns of data you want to see. In this lesson, you will practice simple queries to fetch specific columns from a table.

## Instructions
1.  Click the link below to start the SQL Zoo lesson.
2.  Modify the query to show the population of Germany.
3.  Modify the query to show the population of 'Scandinavia' and 'Polynesia'.
4.  Solve the area calculations.

### ✅ Check
*   You understand \`SELECT column FROM table\`.
*   You understand \`WHERE\` clauses.
*   You understand the \`IN\` keyword.

    content: `
**Goal:** Filter text data using pattern matching.

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to find countries that start or end with specific letters so I can categorize them.

---

## What You'll Do

Sometimes you need to find data that *looks like* a certain pattern, rather than an exact match. SQL uses the \`LIKE\` operator for this.

**Common wildcards:**
* \`%\` matches any sequence of characters
* \`_\` matches a single character

## Instructions
1.  Complete the SQL Zoo pattern matching exercises.
2.  Find countries starting with 'Y'.
3.  Find countries ending with 'y'.
4.  Find countries containing the letter 'x'.

### 🔍 Diving Deeper
The \`%\` symbol is a wildcard. 
- \`'A%'\` means "Starts with A".
- \`'%a'\` means "Ends with a".
- \`'%a%'\` means "Contains a".

**User Story:** As a geographer, I want to filter countries based on population, GDP, and area to perform complex analysis.

---

## What You'll Do

Now we dive deeper. You will query the 'World' country profile table. This lesson reinforces \`WHERE\` clauses and introduces comparison operators like \`>\`, \`<\`, and logic like \`AND\` / \`OR\`.

## Instructions
1.  Go to the SQL Zoo lesson linked below.
2.  Write queries to find countries with large populations.
3.  Use \`AND\` to combine conditions (e.g., big area AND big population).
4.  Use \`XOR\` (Exclusive OR) if requested.

### ✅ Check
*   You can use \`>=\` and \`<=\`.
*   You can combine logic with \`AND\`, \`OR\`.

## What You'll Do

You will query a table of Nobel Prize winners. Pay attention to how you handle strings (text needs quotes like \`'Physics'\`) and numbers (years do not need quotes).

## Instructions
1.  Find winners from the year 1950.
2.  Find who won the 'Literature' prize in 1962.
3.  Find all winners from a specific era.

### 💡 Tip
Text strings always need single quotes: \`subject = 'Chemistry'\`. 
Numbers do not: \`yr = 1970\`.

---

## What You'll Do

Now that you know the syntax, let's use a real tool. Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative built on top of PostgreSQL.

## Instructions
1.  Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and open your project.
2.  Navigate to the **Table Editor** (icon looks like a grid).
3.  Create a new table named \`potluck_dinners\`.
4.  Add the following columns:
    *   \`id\` (int8, primary key, usually auto-created)
    *   \`family\` (text)
    *   \`dish\` (text)
    *   \`serves\` (int2 or int4)
    *   \`type_of_dish\` (text) - e.g., 'entree', 'side', 'dessert'
5.  Add at least 3 dummy rows using the "Insert Row" button.

### ✅ Check
*   Table \`potluck_dinners\` exists.
*   Columns \`family\`, \`dish\`, \`serves\`, \`type_of_dish\` exist.
*   You have at least 3 rows of data.

1.  Click on the **SQL Editor** icon in the left sidebar of Supabase.
2.  Click "New Query".
3.  Copy and run the examples below against your \`potluck_dinners\` table.

## Instructions

A database is boring with only 3 rows. Let's make it realistic.

1.  Go back to the **Table Editor**.
2.  Add **5-10 more entries**.
    *   Have families bring multiple items.
    *   Have multiple items of the same type (e.g., 3 different desserts).
3.  Return to the **SQL Editor** and practice:
    *   Find all dishes that serve more than 8 people.
    *   Find all desserts.

### ✅ Check
*   Your table has > 8 rows.
*   You have successfully run a query filtering by \`serves > 8\`.

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to explore a large dataset to discover interesting patterns and insights.

---

## ⚡ Challenge Mode

Now it's time to get creative! You imported a dataset from Code.org earlier (movies, music charts, or another dataset). This is a much larger and more complex table than our simple potluck database.

**Your Mission:**
Explore your imported dataset and write queries to answer interesting questions. There are no "correct" answers here - the goal is to practice thinking like a data analyst.

**Instructions:**
1.  Open your Supabase SQL Editor.
2.  Look at your Code.org table to see what columns are available.
3.  Come up with at least 3-5 interesting questions you can answer with SQL.
4.  Write and run queries to find the answers.

**Example Questions (adjust based on your dataset):**
- **Movies:** What's the oldest movie in the database? Which genre appears most often?
- **Music:** Which artist has the most songs? What year had the most releases?
- **General:** What's the average value of a numeric column? How many unique entries exist?

### 💡 Tips
*   Use \`SELECT DISTINCT\` to find unique values
*   Use \`ORDER BY\` with \`LIMIT\` to find top/bottom results
*   Combine \`COUNT\`, \`SUM\`, \`AVG\` with \`GROUP BY\` for powerful insights
*   Use \`LIKE\` for pattern matching in text fields

### ✅ Check
*   You've written at least 3 different queries
*   You've used at least 2 different aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
*   You've discovered something interesting about your data!

## ⚡⚡ ADVANCED Challenge Mode

This is the ultimate challenge! You'll need to combine everything you've learned: WHERE clauses, aggregate functions, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and creative thinking.

**Your Mission:**
Answer increasingly complex questions about your Code.org dataset. Each question requires combining multiple SQL concepts.

**Instructions:**
1.  These challenges build on each other in complexity
2.  Start with the easier ones and work your way up
3.  Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes
4.  Use the AI Tutor if you get stuck - that's what it's there for!

### 🏆 Challenge Levels

**Level 1: Filtering + Aggregation**
- Find the average of something, but only for a specific category
- Example: "What's the average rating for action movies?"

**Level 2: Grouping + Sorting**
- Group by one column, aggregate another, then sort the results
- Example: "Which year had the most movies released?"

**Level 3: Complex Combinations**
- Combine multiple WHERE conditions with GROUP BY and ORDER BY
- Example: "For movies after 2010, which genre has the highest average rating?"

### 💡 Pro Tips
*   Break complex problems into smaller steps
*   Test each part of your query separately
*   Use comments (--) to document your thinking
*   The HAVING clause can filter results AFTER grouping

### ✅ Check
*   You've successfully used GROUP BY with an aggregate function
*   You've combined WHERE with GROUP BY
*   You've used ORDER BY to sort aggregated results
*   You feel confident exploring data with SQL!
